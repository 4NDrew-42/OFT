# Deployment Issue Diagnosis - Expenses API 400 Error Persists

**Date**: October 6, 2025, 10:50 PM CDT
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **DEPLOYMENT ISSUE IDENTIFIED**

---

## üö® CRITICAL FINDING

**The fixes are in the source code but NOT deployed to production!**

### Evidence

**1. Source Code** ‚úÖ HAS FIXES
```typescript
// frontend/apps/web/src/app/expenses/page.tsx
amount: Math.round(amountNum * 100),  // Convert dollars to cents
```

**2. Local Build** ‚úÖ HAS FIXES
```
.next/static/chunks/app/expenses/page-616ae21cb5ceebaa.js
```

**3. Production Deployment** ‚ùå OLD CODE
```
https://www.sidekickportal.com/_next/static/chunks/app/expenses/page-83660173c7da40e6.js
```

**Bundle Hash Mismatch**:
- Local: `page-616ae21cb5ceebaa.js` (built Oct 6, 22:31)
- Production: `page-83660173c7da40e6.js` (old build)

## üîç ROOT CAUSE

**Vercel did NOT auto-deploy after git push!**

Possible reasons:
1. Vercel webhook not configured for this repository
2. Vercel project settings pointing to wrong branch
3. Vercel build failed silently
4. Manual deployment required

---

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION

### Option A: Manual Vercel Deployment (RECOMMENDED)

```bash
cd /tank/webhosting/sites/ai-marketplace
vercel --prod
```

### Option B: Trigger Deployment via Vercel Dashboard

1. Go to https://vercel.com/4ndrew42s-projects/oft
2. Click "Deployments" tab
3. Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment
4. Select "Production" environment
5. Click "Redeploy"

### Option C: Force Push to Trigger Webhook

```bash
cd /tank/webhosting/sites/ai-marketplace
git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: Trigger Vercel deployment"
git push origin main
```

---

## üß™ VERIFICATION STEPS

After deployment:

### 1. Check Bundle Hash Changed
```bash
curl -s "https://www.sidekickportal.com/expenses" | grep -o 'page-[a-f0-9]*.js'
# Should show: page-616ae21cb5ceebaa.js (or newer)
# NOT: page-83660173c7da40e6.js
```

### 2. Verify Amount Conversion in Bundle
```bash
curl -s "https://www.sidekickportal.com/_next/static/chunks/app/expenses/page-*.js" | grep -o "Math.round.*100"
# Should return: Math.round(e*100) or similar
```

### 3. Test in Browser
1. Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
2. Open DevTools ‚Üí Network tab ‚Üí Clear
3. Try creating an expense
4. Check if 400 error persists

### 4. Run E2E Tests Again
```bash
bash /tmp/run_e2e_tests.sh
```

## üìä CURRENT STATUS

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Source Code** | ‚úÖ FIXED | Commit b55f73b |
| **Local Build** | ‚úÖ FIXED | Built Oct 6, 22:31 |
| **Git Push** | ‚úÖ COMPLETE | Pushed to origin/main |
| **Vercel Deploy** | ‚ùå FAILED | Old bundle still served |
| **Production** | ‚ùå BROKEN | 400 errors persist |

---

## üéØ IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

**USER MUST:**
1. Manually deploy to Vercel (Option A, B, or C above)
2. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete
3. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
4. Test expense creation
5. Report if 400 error persists

**IF 400 ERROR STILL PERSISTS AFTER DEPLOYMENT:**
Then we need to investigate the actual payload being sent by the browser:
1. Expand "Saving expense: Object" in console
2. Copy Request Payload from Network tab
3. Copy Response body from Network tab
4. This will show us if there's a different bug

---

## üí° WHY E2E TESTS PASSED BUT BROWSER FAILS

**E2E tests ran from the server** using curl, which hit the backend API directly.
**Browser is using old JavaScript** that doesn't have the fixes.

This is why:
- ‚úÖ Server-side E2E tests passed (backend is fixed)
- ‚ùå Browser still fails (frontend not deployed)

---

## ÔøΩÔøΩ LONG-TERM FIX

### Configure Vercel Auto-Deploy

1. Go to Vercel project settings
2. Ensure "Git Integration" is enabled
3. Verify "Production Branch" is set to "main"
4. Check "Deploy Hooks" are configured
5. Test by making a dummy commit

### Add Deployment Verification

Create `.github/workflows/verify-deployment.yml`:
```yaml
name: Verify Deployment
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  verify:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Wait for Vercel deployment
        run: sleep 120
      - name: Check bundle hash
        run: |
          HASH=$(curl -s "https://www.sidekickportal.com/expenses" | grep -o 'page-[a-f0-9]*.js')
          echo "Deployed bundle: $HASH"
      - name: Verify fixes present
        run: |
          curl -s "https://www.sidekickportal.com/_next/static/chunks/app/expenses/page-*.js" | grep "Math.round.*100" || exit 1
```

## üìû SUPPORT

If manual deployment fails:
1. Check Vercel dashboard for build errors
2. Check Vercel logs for deployment failures
3. Verify Vercel project is linked to correct repository
4. Verify Vercel has access to GitHub repository
